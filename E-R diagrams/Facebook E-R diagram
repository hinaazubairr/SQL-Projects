In this section, I would design a database for a social media site like Facebook.		
		
STEP BY STEP DESIGN OF FACEBOOK		
	Facebook is a social network or a website that allows us to:	
		create a profile,
		connect with other profiles by adding them as our friends,
		share content such as text posts, photos and videos.
		
	I'll not develop the website here. I am just designing the database.	
		
	Basic Features of Facebook: which I am going to cover in this section	
	1. sign up and create a profile.	
	2. Add other profiles as friends	
	3. Add posts that contain text, photos or videos.	
	4. See posts that friends have added	
	5. Like and add comments to posts others have added.	
		
	I am going to create a database design that could implement these features.	
		
	1. sign up and create a profile.	
		
	I use LucidChart to draw all of my database diagrams.

	In order to create a profile, I can assume that a user needs to enter some information.	
		some of the information is mandatory such as an email address, password and name.
		Other information may be optional like country, date of birth etc.
	Lets create our first table for storing user information.  Call it 'user_profile'	
		in this table, we add several attributes, which are our columns.
		attributes are: email, password, name, country, date of birth
		
	<b> Primary key:</b> Itâ€™s a good idea to have a unique way of identifying this record.	
		create a new column to store a unique ID.
