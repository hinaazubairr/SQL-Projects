In this section, I would design a database for a social media site like Facebook.		
		
<b> STEP BY STEP DESIGN OF FACEBOOK		</b>
	Facebook is a social network or a website that allows us to:	
		create a profile,
		connect with other profiles by adding them as our friends,
		share content such as text posts, photos and videos.
		
	I'll not develop the website here. I am just designing the database.
